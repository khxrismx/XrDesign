    <h1>Unity Environment Project</h1>
    <p>For this project I was inspired by the children's book The Rainbow Fish. As a child I found its illustrations immersive and I wanted to create a world that 
        evoked those same feelings of wonder. I used an ocean asset pack from the Unity Asset Store. I rearranged and added the prefabs to my liking and used materials made up of watercolor textures
        to match the illustrations from the book. I made one of the fish prefabs the "player" object by attaching the main camera to it and a behavior script that allows the user to move the fish, using WASD, 
        Spacebar, and Ctrl. I planned to make the player interact with the other fish, but I had an issue with the colliders. If I had more time, I would figure out the issue to do this and also prevent the player 
        from spinning after hitting an object. I also added spatial audio to the shark, but it does not work, so I would like to fix that as well.
